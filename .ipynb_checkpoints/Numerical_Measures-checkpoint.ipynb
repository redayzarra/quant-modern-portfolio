    "**Mean:** The mean or expected value E(x) of a random variable is the average value in the population. We can calculate the expected with the equation below. In the equation, a certain probability (p) is multiplied to the number of possible outcomes (x). **Sum of the outcomes multiplied by the probability of the outcomes.**\n",
